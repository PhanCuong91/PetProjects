Introdution:

Readwise is really good to revisit your highlights from a lot of sources as Kindle, iBooks, Instapaper, Pocket ... via daily email, but you have pay 4.49 dollars each month, it is only a cup of coffee price. To avoid this payment, I create a simple system to revisit all my highlights once opening my laptop. The system still need Readwise as a main highlight source :).


Instruction:

-	You must have a Readwise account.
- 	To access highlights in Readwise, you need Readwise token. The token is in the link readwise.io/access_token
- 	Add your token to system environment variable:
		Variable name: ReadwiseToken
		Variable value: <Readwise Token>
- 	Add python.sh to your Startup folder. To open this folder, 
		click "Window" + "R"
		type: "shell:startup" then enter
-	Set NUM_HIGHLIGHTS as the number of highlights you want to read
